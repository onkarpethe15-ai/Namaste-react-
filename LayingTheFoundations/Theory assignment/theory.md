- - What is JSX?
    JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without need of writing any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.

example of creating element with jsx and without jsx

- with jsx :
  const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
  root.render(myElement);

- withoutusing jsx

const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);

- - Superpowers of JSX.
    jsx is very powerful with the help of jsx we can create react elements and react components very easily.
    code becomes more readble
    code becomes easy to understand
    as jsx is kind mix syntax of html and javascript it also allows to write javascript logic inside react element which created using jsx
    - example =>
      <!-- function greeting(user) {
      //JSX
      return <h1>{user}, How are you!!!</h1>;
      } -->

* - Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

The type attribute specifies the type of the script. The type attribute identifies the content between the <script> and </script> tags. It has a Default value which is “text/javascript”.

type attribute can be of the following types:
text/javascript : It is the basic standard of writing javascript code inside the <script> tag.
Syntax

<script type="text/javascript"></script>

text/ecmascript : this value indicates that the script is following the EcmaScript standards.
module: This value tells the browser that the script is a module that can import or export other files or modules inside it.
text/babel : This value indicates that the script is a babel type and required bable to transpile it.
text/typescript: As the name suggest the script is written in TypeScript.

- - {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX.
    The Difference is stated below:

{TitleComponent}: This value describes the TitleComponent as a javascript expression or a variable. The {} can embed a javascript expression or a variable inside it.
<TitleComponent/> : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms TitleComponent a function that is returning a JSX value. A component is written inside the {< />} expression.
<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> : <TitleComponent /> and <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> are equivalent only when < TitleComponent /> has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.
Example
<TitleComponent>
<FirstChildComponent />
<SecondChildComponent />
<ThirdChildComponent />
</TitleComponent>
